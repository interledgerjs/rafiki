/**
 * Check whether a route can be filtered out based on DRAGON rules.
 *
 * See http://route-aggregation.net/.
 *
 * The basic idea is that if we have a more general route that is as good as a
 * more specific route, we don't need to advertise the more specific route.
 *
 * This removes a lot of routing updates across a large network and has basically
 * no downside.
 *
 * Note that we use DRAGON filtering, but *not* DRAGON aggregation. There are
 * several reasons for this:
 *
 *  * ILP address space is a lot less dense than IPv4 address space, so
 *    DRAGON aggregation would not be a significant optimization.
 *
 *  * We may want to secure our routing protocol using a mechanism similar to
 *    BGPsec, which precludes aggregation.
 *
 *  * We will recommend that owners of tier-1 ILP address space are also real
 *    connectors which participate in the routing protocol and originate a route
 *    advertisement for their tier-1 prefix. This will enable DRAGON filtering
 *    to apply to a lot more situations where otherwise only DRAGON aggregation
 *    would be applicable.
