# ilp-routing
> (BETA Stage) Router and Route Manager for Interledger-style addressing

<!-- ## Usage

```js
// TypeScript
import Router from 'ilp-router'

``` -->

## Project


## Members

### ilp-router
Stand alone router for ilp address space. Contains a routing table and a forwarding routing table. Routing table is used to determine where the nextHop is based on a given address. The forwarding routing table is used to broadcasting routes to peers.

### ilp-route-manager
A route manager that deals with adding/removing peers and adding/removing routes for given peers. Based on these it will update the routing table accordingly.

#### Note CCP is outside the scope of the functionalities of this library.

### Folders

All source code is expected to be TypeScript and is placed in the `src` folder. Tests are put in the `test` folder.

The NPM package will not contain any TypeScript files (`*.ts`) but will have typings and source maps.

### TODO
- [ ] Add Logging
- [ ] Add example file
- [ ] Add Auth
- [x] Add weight to lessen the need for relations to be used
- [ ] Add Performance Regression
- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Ensure adding and removing routes are deterministic and no race conditions exist
- [ ] Add dragon filtering back to the layer between the routing and forwarding routing table
- [ ] Create a more favorable data structure for Peers incoming routes table. One way this can be achieved is having a write heavy data structure that is read fast. (This is probably preferable.)

### Future notes/reading
Implement BGP type path based filtering

Multipath could also be an interesting area to pursue.
